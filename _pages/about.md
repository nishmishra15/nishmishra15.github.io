I am Nishchaya Kumar Mishra, a PhD scholar in the Department of Civil Engineering at Indian Inatitute of Technology Gandhinagar, India. My current work at IIT Gandhinagar lies at the inetrsection of control algorithms and indoor air quality. The overarching goal is to develop physics-driven and aritificial intelligence control algorithms that are deployable at community scale. 

Themes of my PhD work and highlights:
---
Dynamic Optimization of Exposure and Energy While Ensuring Thermal Comfort
---
1. Indoor PM mitigation and energy consumption trade-off require optimization.
2. Energy normalized exposure reduction quantifies the energy-exposure trade-off.
3. Desired exposure reductions with higher NER can be achieved via optimization.
4. Increasing indoor set temperature lowers energy penalty when it is hotter outside.
5. Internal filtration offsets the high energy penalty associated with exfiltration.
